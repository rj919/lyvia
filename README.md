# Lyvia
_A Platform to Spot Sleep Disruptions in People Suffering from Alzheimers_  
**by Jeffrey H, Plamedi M and Richard J**

Intro
-----
Lyvia is a platform installed in the bedroom of a parent or loved one diagnosed with Alzheimers. Lyvia listens to bedroom noise for anomalous behavior over a series of nights which might indicate a change in mental state. Significant changes trigger an alert to the caregiver and encourage them to check up on their loved one.
